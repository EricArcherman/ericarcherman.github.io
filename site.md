ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Eric

- currently a sophomore at the roxbury latin school in boston
- learning ai (thank you andrej karpathy)
- interested in zkp (zero-knowledge proofs)
    - have done research on zero-knowledge virtual machines in the past (making a16z's jolt 2x faster with architectural optimizations)
    - thank you to Simon Langowski, Srini Devadas, and MIT PRIMES for the guidance
- used to trade options
    - btc's vol curve is heavily mispriced on the wings
    - trading's a great way to practice controlling your emotions and maintaining discipline


I want to write up my zk and options notes but haven't found the time yet. maybe someday when i can double it for some school project as well
